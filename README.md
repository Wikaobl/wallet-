## Description 
This project is a tool for tracking income and expenses. It displays a list of all your transactions along with an area indicating your available funds (the sum of incomes and expenses). To add a new transaction, simply click on “dodaj transakcję”. You will be able to enter the transaction name, amount, and category (e.g., shopping, food). If needed, you can delete all transactions using the "usuń wszystko" button. Additionally, you have the option to choose between two page styles: light or dark.
