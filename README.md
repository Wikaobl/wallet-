## Description 
This project is a tool for tracking **income** and **expenses**. It displays a list of all your transactions along with an area indicating your available funds (the sum of incomes and expenses). To add a new transaction, simply click on "**_dodaj transakcjƒô_**". You will be able to enter the transaction name, amount, and category (e.g., shopping, food). If needed, you can delete all transactions using the "**_usu≈Ñ wszystko_**" button. Additionally, you have the option to choose between two page styles: *light* or *dark*.
In this project, I used **_JavaScript_**, **_CSS_**, and **_HTML_**.
